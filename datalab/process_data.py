#Obtain data on each state quarter (state, year issued, and description for each)


#Script that reads text from PDF -- extracts relevant parts & saves as database (either MySQL or JSON data)

#Try PyPDF2 (which may or may not work on these PDFs) or select all of the text, paste all of it into a new text document,
# and process that.
#Don't copy and paste each state's info individually! This database will be used by your website.

#To install it, run pip install PyPDF2 (import PyPDF2 in interactive shell) https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter13/

#https://www.usmint.gov/downloads/mint_programs/50sqReport.pdf
#pg.23 Appendix has design description (+1 to page number if using PyPDF2)
